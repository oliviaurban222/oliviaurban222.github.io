		Family is another huge part of my life. My family and I are very close and stay in touch constantly. My family includes my brother, my mom, my dad, my dog, and I. My brother is 3 years older than me and currently lives in Seattle, Wisconsin working for an accounting firm. My mom and dad still live in Indianapolis, Indiana and love it there. It is quite different living in a different state than all of my family members, but going to school in a different state has been very rewarding. Below are photos of each of my family members.  </p>
